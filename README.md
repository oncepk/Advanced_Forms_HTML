# Advanced_Forms_HTML

Forms lesson we took a look at basic form creation and some of the tags and attributes available. In this lesson we take a final look at forms with the remaining HTML tags we haven't used for form entry so far, these being the <datalist>, <fieldset>, <legend>, <optgroup>, <option>, <output> and <select> tags.

This the lesson I just learning and practice following this Website " https://server2client.com/htmladvanced/advancedforms.html "
